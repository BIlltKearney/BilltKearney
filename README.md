Hello!

<!--
**BIlltKearney/BilltKearney** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I love creating and building things, I always have. Being a web developer allows me to do something I love, online. Presently, I am working as a Graphic Arts Technology Education teacher. In the past I have worked as a freelance web developer, worked in telecommunications, electro-mechanical manufacturing, and served full-time in the US ARMY.

Right now I am back in CT after finishing a 2-year exploration of the US with my family, visiting national parks, cities, museums, and whatever else sparks our interest. I am originally from CT but have lived in WA, UT, CO, OK, and NC. I have visited all 50 US states and several other countries.

When I am not working, I like to keep up on new innovations in industry and business as well as exploring life with my family, hiking, biking, telemark skiing, :cloud:flying my paraglider, learning to ride a unicycle, and learning to juggle clubs. My family and I are into activity and health and we eat a whole food plant-based diet.
