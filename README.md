Hello!

I love creating and building things, I always have. Being a web developer allows me to do something I love, online. Presently, I am working as a Graphic Arts Technology Education teacher. In the past I have worked as a freelance web developer, worked in telecommunications, electro-mechanical manufacturing, and served full-time in the US ARMY.

Right now I am back in CT after finishing a 2-year exploration of the US with my family, visiting national parks, cities, museums, and whatever else sparks our interest. I am originally from CT but have lived in WA, UT, CO, OK, and NC. I have visited all 50 US states and several other countries.

When I am not working, I like to keep up on new innovations in industry and business as well as exploring life with my family, hiking, biking, telemark skiing :snowflake:, flying my paraglider :cloud:, learning to ride a unicycle, and learning to juggle clubs. My family and I are into activity and health and we eat a whole food plant-based diet â“‹.
